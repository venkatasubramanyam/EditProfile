/**
 * Custom Bus based on RxJava, specifically it's PublishSubject class, which allows for new subscribers
 * to receive all subsequent emitted events. RxBus allows for communication between application components using
 * Subscribe and Publish on event types.
 * <p>
 * All new subscribers must subscribe (by calling {@link #subscribe(int, Object, Consumer)}) to desired {@code Subject} event type in onStart()(Both Activity and Fragment).
 * <p>
 * All subscribers must call {@link #unregister(Object)} in onStop() (Both Activity and Fragment)
 * <p>
 * To add new event types available to be subscribed/published to, First, add a Constant class variable with a
 * unique int value, Second, add said Constant to {@code Subject} annotation.
 * <p>
 * To subscribe, call {@link #subscribe(int, Object, Consumer)}) where {@Code int} is event type to subscribe to,
 * {@Code Object} is the LifeCycle owner, {@code Consumer} is the action to be implemented on received event.
 * <p>
 * !IMPORTANT! ---> FURTHER READING/FIXING SEE ---> https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxRelay/issues/7 where Jack Wharton discusses
 * on why we should diminish subjects as application becoming more increasingly reactive and use streams and
 * exposing Observables instead (Jake argues he is yet to see a use of subjects that is not anti-pattern in
 * reactive programming).
